## Installation

DeepDRR requires an NVIDIA GPU, preferably with >11 GB of memory.

1. Install CUDA. Version 11 is recommended, but DeepDRR has been used with 8.0
2. Make sure your C compiler is on the path. DeepDRR has been used with `gcc 9.3.0`
3. We recommend installing pycuda separately, as it may need to be built. If you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), run
